# TODO:
## RECORDING MODE:
* The user is asked a bpm value, the program will start a metronome at that bpm
* Add a button to save the recorded audio

## UPLOAD MODE:
* The BPM can't be known in advance
* Ask the user to either set the bpm of their file or upload a file with a given bpm value

## MAIN / COMMON MODE:
* The mode only influences the way the user gets to the first audio; after that, the user can always choose to record or upload a new file
* Peak detection
* Polyrhythm detection
* Rhythm wheel (needs to be created after the user has selected the correct polyrhythm)
* Transition to training
* Euclidean wheel

## TRAINING MODE:
* Button to go back to _main mode_

## METHODS:
* Try to port CMRM implementation of tempogram

## IF THERE'S TIME:
* Implement a createGraphics approach to manage helper text

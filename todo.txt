TODO:
RECORDING MODE:
-The user is asked a bpm value, the program will start a metronome at that bpm
-Add a button to save the recorded audio

UPLOAD MODE:
-The BPM can't be known in advance
-Ask the user to either set the bpm of their file or upload a file with a given
 bpm value

BOTH:
-The mode only influences the way the user gets to the first audio; after that, 
the user can always choose to record or upload a new file
-Peak detection
-Polyrhythm detection

IF THERE'S TIME:
-Implement a createGraphics approach to manage helper text
